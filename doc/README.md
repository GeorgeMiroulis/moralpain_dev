# What's This Directory About?

This directory contains a clone of our student facing environment for Program and Data Representation.

To use it, please (1) fork it, (2) clone your fork to your local machine, (3) open the new folder in VSCode with the Remote Containers extension enabled, (4) let VSCode build and boot the development environment container. This will take a minute or two the first time through and will be even quicker on subsequent development sessions.
